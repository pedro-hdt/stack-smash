# CS3235 - Assignment 2

## Exercise 1 - Buffer Overflow

The script build_exploits.py automatically generates the files (exploit1 and
exploit2) such that running `./buffer_overflow` causes a shell to be spawned.

To run the attack just use the sequence of commands:
```
make
python3 build_exploits.py
./buffer_overflow
```
